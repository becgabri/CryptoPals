# CryptoPals
My personal work for crypto pals challenges, done in python3 --- this is just for fun.

Any implementation of an algorithm present in this repository (MersenneTwister, SHA1, MD4, AES) is NOT guaranteed to be secure, efficient, or even correct for that matter. To drive home this point further, three out of those four are guaranteed to be INSECURE. This is merely for entertainment and practice. If you would like to try and reproduce anything, add the directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.
